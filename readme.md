# math-rad.com

Hello. This is the github repo for my domain math-rad.com. It is comprised of several subdomains, each with their own purpose, as well as the root domain(math-rad.com). Here you will find the code used to manage my domain. It used to be in multiple folders, each with their own respective subdomain, but that workflow changed when I needed to route traffic from my router with an express app. I only use two ports now: one for the subdomains and one for the root.
